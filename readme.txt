This is for git learning and testing.
I added this file on the local dev branch and pushed this to the dev branch on Github.
Now I am further revising it and will pull it from the local dev branch.
It is a good practice to have your master branch stable and only work on the dev branch and features branches. 
When one feature branch is done, merge it with the dev branch.
Only when the dev branch is complete and tested, merge it with the master branch.
